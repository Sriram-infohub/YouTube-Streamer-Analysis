# YouTube Streamer Analysis

This project focuses on building a **Content Recommendation System** for YouTube users based on streamers' performance metrics and user preferences. It aims to enhance the user experience by suggesting channels and videos that align with the userâ€™s watch history and preferred categories.

## Features

- Rank: The ranking of the YouTuber.
- Username: The name of the YouTube channel.
- Categories: The content categories (some entries are missing).
- Subscribers: The number of subscribers (in float format).
- Country: The country where the channel is based.
- Visits: The total visits to the channel.
- Likes: The total likes on the channel's videos.
- Comments: The total number of comments.
- Links: The URL link to the YouTube channel.

# Guidelines for Project Components:
 
## 1.DATA EXPLORATION
- Start by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and identify key variables.
- Check for missing data and outliers.
## 2.Finding Outliers using Boxplot

## 3.Trend Analyisis
- Identify trends among the top YouTube streamers. Which categories are the most popular?
- Is there a correlation between the number of subscribers and the number of likes or comments?

## 4.Audience Study
- Analyze the distribution of streamers' audiences by country. Are there regional preferences for
specific content categories?
## 5.Performance Metrics
- Calculate and visualize the average number of subscribers, visits, likes, and comments.
- Are there patterns or anomalies in these metrics?

## 8.Benchmarking
- Identify streamers with above-average performance in terms of subscribers, visits, likes, and comments.
- Who are the top-performing content creators?
## 9.Content Recommendations
-Propose a system for enhancing content recommendations to YouTube users based on streamers categories and performance metrics

-**Design and implement a recommendation system that suggests channels and videos based on
User's watch history and preferred categories and Streamer performance within those categories.**


## Usage

1. **Run the notebook**: Open the `YT_Streamer.ipynb` in Jupyter and run each cell to load the data, process it, and generate recommendations.
2. **Modify recommendations**: You can tweak the recommendation logic by adjusting the performance metrics or filtering criteria in the code.
